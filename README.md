Dear all,

please see the todo list below and push your codes to a branch and open a PR. you may remove `__init__.py` from your folder.

**Please add a description of your code in this readme file so that we can after collecting all info organize it. 
your description doesn't need to be very detailed, but it should be detailed enough for a user to be able to 
orient themselves in the repo.**
